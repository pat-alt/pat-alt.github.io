{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"**Researching Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Finance and Economics**. I am an economist by background with an interest in cross-disciplinary research on the intersection of Trustworthy AI - in particular Interpretability, Probabilistic ML, Algorithmic Recourse, Causal Inference - and Financial Economics. Currently I'm studying for a PhD in Trustworthy AI under supervision of [Cynthia Liem](https://www.cynthialiem.com) at [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl/). I'm also a member of the [AI for Fintech Research collaboration](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4fintech/index.html) between [Delft University of Technology](https://tudelft.nl/) and [ING](https://ing.com/). \n\nPreviously, I worked as an economist for [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk) where I was involved in research, monetary policy briefings and market intelligence. I hold two masters degrees from [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu), one in [Data Science](https://bse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science-methodology) and one in [Finance](https://bse.eu/study/masters-programs/finance). I also hold an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). \n\nDownloadable resume: [[pdf](/www/cv/_cv.pdf)], [[html](/www/cv/_cv.html)].
