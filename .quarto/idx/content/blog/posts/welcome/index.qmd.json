For a while I have been thinking about a good way to share some of my work and actually started collecting snippets in a [Gitbook](https://pat-alt.github.io/fromScratch/) through [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) quite some time ago. While the book is a work-in-progress that I aim to finish eventually, I will use this website to regularly share content related to my work, research and other things. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n**Update on Feb 20, 2022**\n\nI have recently migrated this blog and pretty much everything else I do to [quarto](https://quarto.org/). \n\n> QuartoÂ® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.\n\nBased on my first few experiences I would go further and say that quarto is *the only* open-source scientific and technical publishing system you'll ever need. The project is supported by RStudio and (unsurprisingly) Yihui Xie is one of the contributors. Go check it out!\n:::\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../../../lua/include-files.lua","quarto"],"css":["../../../../styles.css","../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Show the code"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.624","bibliography":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/bib/main/bib.bib"],"crossref":{"fig-prefix":"Figure","tbl-prefix":"Table"},"_quarto-vars":{"blog-url":"https://www.paltmeyer.com/blog/","bib":{"mine":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/bib/main/mine.bib"}},"theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"author":[{"name":"Patrick Altmeyer","url":"https://www.paltmeyer.com/","affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","affiliation-url":"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/"},"Patrick Altmeyer"],"comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"pat-alt/blog"}},"citation":true,"title":"Welcome","date":"2021-02-01","description":"The obligatory welcome post and a shout-out to Yihui Xie and the folks behind quarto."},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
