This repository contains all the code that builds my personal [website](https://pat-alt.github.io/). It was build through `blogdown`, an R package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/). You can read more about how I got started with `blogdown` and the development of this website in this [post](https://pat-alt.github.io/2021/02/02/how-i-m-building-this-website-in-r/).
