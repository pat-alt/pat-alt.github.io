The ecosystem keeps slowly growing. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch!\n- In July 2024, I presented our position paper \"Stop Making Unscientific AGI Performance Claims\" at ICML 2024. We argue that finding patterns in latent embeddings of models like LLMs is not surprising and call for the academic community to exercise extra caution when interpreting such findings.
