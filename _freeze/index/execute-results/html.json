Previously, I worked as an Economist for the Bank of England.\n\nI primarily code in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia){target=\"_blank\"} and publish through [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev){target=\"_blank\"}. Occasionally I also use R, Python and C++. As much as possible I contribute to **open-source**: [Github](https://github.com/pat-alt){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nYou can find the code that builds this website using [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev){target=\"_blank\"} in this [repo](https://github.com/pat-alt/pat-alt.github.io){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-screen}\n\n::: {.hero-banner}\n\n::: {.hero-banner-carousel}\n\n\n::: {.cell .g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 .g-col-md-12}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.hero-banner-text}\n# News\n\n- On May 7-8, I'll be presenting some of my PhD research at the [DSCNext Conference Europe 2025](https://dscnextcon.com/speaker/patrick/).\n- Taija, the organization that hosts software geared towards Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia, has its own website now: [www.taija.org](https://www.taija.org/). The ecosystem keeps slowly growing. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch!\n- In July 2024, I presented our position paper \"Stop Making Unscientific AGI Performance Claims\" at ICML 2024. We argue that finding patterns in latent embeddings of models like LLMs is not surprising and call for the academic community to exercise extra caution when interpreting such findings.
