Our team of five students has made multiple improvements to [LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/LaplaceRedux.jl), due to Patrick Altmeyer. Inspired by its Pythonic counterpart, [laplacet-torch](https://github.com/AlexImmer/Laplace), this Julia library aims to provide low-overhead Bayesian uncertainty calibration to deep neural networks via Laplace Approximations [@daxberger2021laplace].\n",
        "\n",
        "We will begin by demystifying the technical terms in the last sentence, in order to explain our contributions to the library and highlight some impressions from the experience. Note that our team has begun working on this PhD-tier subject only having had some introductory courses on probability and statistics, machine learning, and computational intelligence, without any prior exposure to Julia.\n",

        "## Bayesian Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Uncertainty calibration remains a crucial issue in safety-critical applications of modern AI, as, for instance, in autonomous driving. You would want your car autopilot not only to make accurate predictions but also to indicate when a model prediction is uncertain, to give control back to the human driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "A model is well-calibrated if the confidence of a prediction matches its true error rate. Note that you can have well-fit models that are badly calibrated, and *vice versa* (just like in life, you meet smart people, yet annoyingly arrogant).\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard deep learning training process of gradient descent converges at a weight configuration that minimizes the loss function. The model obtained may be great, yet it is only a point estimate of what the weight parameters should look like.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, with the sheer immensity of the weight space, neural networks are probably underspecified by the data (or, overfit). As neural networks can approximate highly complex functions, many weight configurations would yield roughly the same training loss, yet with varying abilities to generalize outside the training dataset. \n",
        "This is why there are so many regularization methods out there, to keep the models simpler. One radical, yet effective approach is described by @lecun1989optimal:\n",
        "\n",
        "> … it is possible to take a perfectly reasonable network, delete half (or more) of the weights and wind up with a network that works just as well, or better.\n",
        "\n",
        "![The loss landscape. One can imagine gradient descent as a particle, let’s say a ball, or a grain of sand, rolling to the bottom of a pit. Then for Bayesian Learning, we have as if a pile of sand poured around at that bottom point, with the pile being thicker where loss is lower. This proverbial sand pile would represent the posterior parameter distribution. Figure due to @amini2019spatial](www/grad_desc.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The way gradient is usually illustrated is with a picture like the one above a curved terrain of the loss function across the parameter space. Each point of the horizontal plane corresponds to some configuration of parameters. Gradient descent seeks the point at the bottom of this terrain, as the point with the lowest loss, however as the loss-curvature is highly non-convex and high-dimensional there are many directions in which we could move and still maintain a low loss. Thus instead of a singular point we would like to specify a probability distribution around that optimal point. Bayesian methods, and in particular Laplace Approximations, allow us to do this!\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, the Bayesian approach to neural network uncertainty calibration is that of modelling the posterior using Bayes’ Theorem:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \n",
        "p(\\theta \\mid D) = \\tfrac{1}{Z} \\,p(D \\mid \\theta) \\, p(\\theta), \\qquad Z:= p(D) = \\textstyle\\int p(D \\mid \\theta) \\, p(\\theta) \\,d\\theta\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here $p(\\D \\mid \\theta)$ is the likelihood of the data given by the parameters $\\theta$.\n",
        "The prior distribution $p(\\theta)$ specifies our beliefs about what the model parameters would be prior to observing the data. Finally, the intractable constant $\\Z$ is called the evidence: it characterizes the probability of observing $\\D$ as a whole, across all possible parameter settings (see [here](../effortsless-bayesian-dl/index.qmd) for details).\n",
        "\n",
        "For models returning a probability distribution (e.g. classifiers), the loss is commonly defined as the negative log-likelihood. Thus if gradient descent minimizes loss, it maximizes the likelihood, producing the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), which (assuming a uniform prior) also maximizes the posterior. This is why we call this point the *maximum a posteriori*, or the MAP. It makes sense to model this point as the mode of the posterior distribution, which could, for example, be a normal Gaussian distribution (see also the introductory [post](../effortsless-bayesian-dl/index.qmd) on this blog).\n",

        "\n",
        "We do this by a simple-yet-smart trick introduced back in the late 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace, the self-proclaimed “greatest French mathematician of his time”. In general, the Laplace Approximation (LA) aims to find a Gaussian approximation to a probability density (in our case, the posterior) defined over a set of continuous variables (in our case, the weights) [@bishop2006pattern]. We can then estimate the loss (negative log-likelihood) as its second-order Taylor expansion:\n",

What remains is the constant (zeroth-order) term, and the second-order term, containing the Hessian, which is a matrix of partial second-order derivatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then from this approximation, we can derive the long-sought multivariate normal distribution with the MAP as the mean, and the inverted Hessian as the covariance:\n",

        "However, since the Hessian, a square matrix, defines the covariance between all model parameters (upon inversion), of which there may be millions or billions, the computation and storage of the Hessian (not to speak of inversion!) become intractable, as its size scales quadratically with the number of parameters involved. Thus to apply Laplace approximations to large models, we must make some simplifications — which brings us to…\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hessian approximations\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple techniques to approximate the Hessian have arisen from a field adjacent, yet distinct from Bayesian learning — that of second-order optimization, where Hessians are used to accelerate gradient descent convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "One such approximation is the Fisher information matrix, or simply the Fisher:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that if instead of sampling the prediction $\\widehat{y} ~ p(y \\mid f(x_n))$ from the model-defined distribution, we take the actual training-set label $y_n$,\n",
        "the resulting matrix is called the empirical Fisher, which is distinct from the Fisher, yet aligns with it under some conditions, and does *not* generally capture second-order information. See Kunstner et al. (2019) for an excellent discussion on the distinction.\n",
        "\n",

Note that the model does not necessarily output ready target probabilities — for instance, classifiers output *logits*, values that define a probability distribution only after the application of the soft-max.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the Fisher, GGN does not require the network to define a probabilistic model on its output [@botev2017practical].\n",
        "For models defining an exponential family distribution over the output, the two coincide [@kunstner2020limitations].\n",
        "This applies to classifiers since they define a categorical distribution over the output, but not to simple regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "These matrices are quadratically large, it is infeasible to store them in full.\n",
        "The simplest estimation is to model the matrix as a diagonal — however one can easily contemplate how crude this approximation can be: for 100 parameters, only 1% of the full Hessian is captured.\n",
        "\n",
        "A more sophisticated approach, due to Martens and Grosse (2015), is inspired by the observation that in practice the covariance matrices (i.e. inverted Hessians) for neural networks are block-diagonal-dominant.\n",
        "Thus we can effectively model the covariance matrix (and hence the Fisher) as a block-diagonal matrix, where blocks correspond to parameters grouped by layers. \n",
        "Additionally, each block is decomposed into two Kronecker factors, reducing the size of data stored several magnitudes more, at a cost of another assumption.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is also possible to cut the costs by treating only a subset of the model parameters, i.e. a subnetwork, probabilistically, fixing the remaining parameters at their MAP-estimated values.\n",
