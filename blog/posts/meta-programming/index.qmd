On this blog, I typically talk about things that I have *some* understanding of. In this post, I want to try something a little different and instead cover a topic that I am utterly *clueless* about. There's an interesting aspect about Julia, which I know embarrassingly little about at this point: [Metaprogramming](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/). 

Having worked with Julia for about 1.5 years now, I have so far employed a successful strategy of occasionally taking a glimpse at that part of the Julia documentation and then deciding to go back to pretending it never existed. Meanwhile, [Karandeep Singh](https://twitter.com/kdpsinghlab) has stepped on the Julia scence around 5 minutes ago and already developed a package that literally oozes macro: [Tidier.jl](https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl). The package API is such a joy to work with that I have felt inspired to finally take a serious look at what metaprogramming is all about. 

My goal for this post is to get to the point where I can confidently write my first macro for [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) - more on this below! If you are as clueless and curious about the topic as I am, then follow along on a journey into the metaverse. Buckle in though, it's going to be a bumpy ride! You have been warned. 

## 🤔 All right, where to start?

You guessed it, we'll start with the official Julia [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/) on the topic:

> Like Lisp, Julia represents its own code as a data structure of the language itself.

Hmmm ... I know nothing about Lisp and this is already beyond me. Code as a data structure?

Let's first try to understand what exactly metaprogramming is, outside of Julia and Lisp. We'll take a quick detour before we're back. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming#:~:text=Metaprogramming%20is%20a%20programming%20technique,even%20modify%20itself%20while%20running.) has the following to say on the topic:

> Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data.

Right ... What about ChatGPT? I wanted to try out [ReplGPT](https://github.com/ThatcherC/ReplGPT.jl) anyway so here goes^[A very cool package! Funny story, though, I somehow managed to commit my OpenAI API key to GitHub on the first go ([developing](https://github.com/ThatcherC/ReplGPT.jl/issues/8))]:

```{.julia-repl}
julia> using ReplGPT
ChatGPT> Hey hey, can you please explain metaprogramming to me (I have no computer science background, but am experienced with programming and data science)
  Metaprogramming is a programming technique where a program is capable of creating or manipulating code at
  runtime. It involves writing computer programs that create, modify, or analyze other computer programs or data
  about those programs.
```

So, in layman's terms, metaprogramming involves code that generates code - I guess we really have entered the metaverse!

## 📖 Julia docs 

Let's head back to the Julia [documentation (v1.8)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/) and look at the first couple of examples.

### Code as Data Structures

Skipping the details here, it turns out that when I write `1 + 1` in the REPL, Julia first parses this program as a string `"1 + 1` into an expression `ex=:(1 + 1)::Expr`, which is then evaluated `eval(ex)` (@fig-code). I've used a `quote` here to generate the expression because I've used **quoting** before for use with `Documenter.jl`. 

![Key concept: code as a data structure.](www/code-as-data.png){#fig-code}

And if I understand this correctly, the expression `ex::Expr` is literally **code as a data structure**:

```{julia}
#| output: true
ex = :(sum([1,2,3]))
dump(ex)
```

That data structure can be "manipulated from within the language". 

Let's try that! Currently, evaluating this expression yields the `sum` of the `Array`:

```{julia}
#| output: true
eval(ex)
```

Upon manipulation (that sounds weird!), we have:

```{julia}
#| output: true
ex.args[1] = :maximum
eval(ex)
```

Ok ok, things are starting to make sense now! 

### Interpolation

Back to the Julia documentation and next on the agenda we have [Interpolation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#man-expression-interpolation). Skipping the details again, it seems like I can interpolate an expression much like strings. Using interpolation I can recreate the expression from above as follows:

```{julia}
fun = maximum
x = [1,2,3]
ex_from_ex_interpoliation = :($fun($x))
a = eval(ex_from_ex_interpoliation)
```

Using string interpolation is quite similar:

```{julia}
#| output: true

fun = maximum
x = [1,2,3]
ex_from_string_interpolation = Meta.parse("$fun($x)")
eval(ex_from_string_interpolation) == a
```

And much like with function arguments, we can also use splatting:

```{julia}
#| output: true

eval(:(zeros($x...)))
```

Next off, we have [**nested quotes**](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Nested-quote). I can't see myself using these anytime soon but anyway it seems that for each `$` sign that we prepend to `x`, an evaluation is trigged: 

```{julia}
#| output: true

eval(quote quote $$:(x) end end)
```

Moving on, we have [`QuoteNodes`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#man-quote-node), which I will steer clear of because I probably won't be doing any super advanced metaprogramming anytime soon. The next two sections on [evaluating expressions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Evaluating-expressions) and [functions on `Expr`essions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Functions-on-Expressions) also look somewhat more involved than what I need right now, but I expect I'll find myself back here when I write that first macro for [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl).

### Macros 

Ahhh, I see we've finally arrived in [Macroland](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#man-macros)! 

> A macro maps a tuple of arguments to a returned expression, and the resulting expression is compiled directly rather than requiring a runtime eval call.

![Arrived in Macroland.](www/macroland.png){fig-align="right"}

Let's see if we can make sense of this as we move on. The `Hello, world!` example makes the concept quite clear:

```{julia}
#| output: true

macro sayhello(name)
    return :( println("Hello, ", $name) )   # return the expression ...
end
@sayhello "reader"                          # ... to be immediately compiled.
```

It seems that a macro is a way to build and return expressions inside a block (a bit like a function) but on call that expression is immediately evaluated. In other words, we can use macros to write code that generates code that is then evaluated. 

To fully grasp the next [part](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Hold-up:-why-macros?), I should have not skipped the part on [functions on `Expr`essions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Functions-on-Expressions). We'll leave that little nugget for Future Me. That same guy will also have to suffer the consequences of Present Me merely skimming the details in the next [section](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Macro-invocation) on macro invocation. Present Me is impatient and overly confident in the level of knowledge that we have just acquired about metaprogramming. 

Let's get ahead of ourselves and meet the final boss of the metaverse: an Advanced Macro.

## 🔥 BUILD AN ADVANCED MACRO

I'll leave it to you to thoroughly read that section in the Julia [docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Building-an-advanced-macro). Here, we'll jump straight into building the macro I want to have for [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl). I now think it'll be less involved than I thought --- optimism in the face of uncertainty!

![Advanced Macro: the final boss.](www/final-boss.png){fig-align="right"}

### From Off-the-Shelf Counterfactual Generators ...

[`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) is a package for generating Counterfactual Explanations for predictive models $f: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$. This is a relatively recent approach to Explainable AI that I am (probably a little too) excited about and won't dwell on here. For what follows, it suffices to say that generating Counterfactual Explanations can be seen as a generative modelling task because it involves generating samples in the input space: $x \sim \mathcal{X}$. To this end, the package has previously shipped with a number of `Generators`: composite types that contain information about how counterfactuals ought to be generated. 

This has allowed users to specify the type of generator they want to use by instantiating it. For example, the DiCE generator by @mothilal2020explaining could (and still can) be instantiated as follows:

```{julia}
generator = DiCEGenerator()
```

This has been a straightforward way for users to use off-the-shelf counterfactual generators. But relying on separate composite types for this task may have been an overkill. In fact, all this time there was some untapped potential here, as we will see next.

### ... To Composable Generators

One of my key objectives for the package has always been composability. It turns out that many of the various counterfactual generators that have been proposed in the literature, essentially do the same thing: they optimize an objective function. In @altmeyer2023endogenous, we denote that objective formally as follows,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}^\prime &= \arg \min_{\mathbf{s}^\prime \in \mathcal{S}} \left\{  {\text{yloss}(M(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)),y^*)}+ \lambda {\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)) }  \right\} 
\end{aligned} 
$$ {#eq-general}

where $\text{yloss}$ denotes the main loss function and $\text{cost}$ is a penalty term. I won't cover this in any more detail here, but you can read about it in the package [docs](https://juliatrustworthyai.github.io/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/v0.1/explanation/generators/overview/#Gradient-based-Counterfactual-Generators). The important thing is that @eq-general very closely describes how counterfactual search is actually implemented in the package. 

In other words, all generators currently implemented share a common starting point. They largely just vary in the exact way the objective function is specified. This gives rise to an interesting idea: 

> Why not compose generators that combine ideas from different off-the-shelf generators?

I want to give users an easy way to do that, without having to build custom `Generator` types from scratch. This (I think) is a good use case for metaprogramming.

Let's try and see if we can make that work. We'll simply extend `CounterfactualExplanations` right here in this repo hosting the blog (easily done in Julia) and provided everything works out well create a pull request. I already have a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/issues/118) for this with a linked branch, so that's the one I'll use in my environment:

```{.julia}
(metaprogramming) pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl#118-add-losses-and-penalties-modules-or-group-under-objectives-module
julia> using CounterfactualExplanations
```

By the time you're reading this, all changes to that branch will have hopefully already been committed and merged.

Let's start by instantiating a generic generator:

```{julia}
generator = GenericGenerator()
```

Our goal is to create macros that build expressions that, when evaluated, mutate the `generator` instance. 

### Define your `@objective`

Our first and most important macro shall define the counterfactual search objective. In particular, the `@objective` macro should accept an expression that looks much like the right-hand-side of @eq-general, which is essentially just a weighted sum. 

![Sketch of the envisioned `@objective` macro.](www/objective.png)

Let's start with that part. Naively, we could begin by writing it out very literally:

```{.julia}
ex = :(yloss + λ*cost)
eval(ex)
```

Of course, evaluating this expression throws an error because none of the variables are actually defined. Let's work on that ...

For the loss and penalty functions, we will use methods available from the `CounterfactualExplanations.Objectives` module, while for $\lambda$ we will use a literal:

```{julia}
ex = :(logitbinarycrossentropy + 0.1 * distance_l2)
```

Let's try to make sense of the data structure we have created:

```{julia}
#| output: true

ex.args
```

My first naive approach is shown below. It errors because I forgot to interpolate the variables inside the `quote`.

```{.julia}
macro objective(generator, ex)
    loss = ex.args[2]
    ex_penalty = ex.args[3]
    λ = ex_penalty.args[2]
    cost = ex_penalty.args[3]
    ex_generator = quote 
        generator.loss = loss
        generator.cost = cost
        generator.λ = λ
    end
    return ex_generator
end
```

Having fixed that below, I still get an error because `loss` and `cost` functions are not part of the global scope. I am pretty sure that this error would have occurred anyway and has nothing to do with the fact that I'm writing a macro. 

```{.julia}
macro objective(generator, ex)
    loss = ex.args[2]
    ex_penalty = ex.args[3]
    λ = ex_penalty.args[2]
    cost = ex_penalty.args[3]
    ex_generator = quote 
        $generator.loss = $loss
        $generator.cost = $cost
        $generator.λ = $λ
    end
    return ex_generator
end
```

Instead of importing the functions, I just get them explicitly from the `Objectives` module, 

```{julia}
macro objective(generator, ex)
    loss = getfield(CounterfactualExplanations.Objectives, ex.args[2])
    ex_penalty = ex.args[3]
    λ = ex_penalty.args[2]
    cost = getfield(CounterfactualExplanations.Objectives, ex_penalty.args[3])
    ex_generator = quote 
        $generator.loss = $loss
        $generator.penalty = $cost
        $generator.λ = $λ
        generator
    end
    return ex_generator
end
```

and, finally, this works:

```{julia}
#| output: ture

@objective(generator, logitbinarycrossentropy + 0.1distance_l2)
```

But what about adding multiple penalties? The DiCE generator, for example, also takes into account how diverse the counterfactual explanations are [@mothilal2020explaining]. The corresponding penalty is called `ddp_diversity`. Let's start with the expression again:

```{julia}
#| output: true

ex = :(logitbinarycrossentropy + 0.1distance_l2 + 1.0ddp_diversity)
ex.args
```

```{julia}
#| output: true
#| echo: false

Markdown.parse(
    """
    This time there's a second nested `Expr`ession among the arguments: `:($(ex.args[end]))`.
    """
)
```

```{julia}
macro objective(generator, ex)
    loss = getfield(CounterfactualExplanations.Objectives, ex.args[2])
    Λ = Vector{AbstractFloat}()
    costs = Vector{Function}()
    for i in 3:length(ex.args)
        ex_penalty = ex.args[i]
        λ = ex_penalty.args[2]
        push!(Λ, λ)
        cost = getfield(CounterfactualExplanations.Objectives, ex_penalty.args[3])
        push!(costs, cost)
    end
    ex_generator = quote 
        $generator.loss = $loss
        $generator.penalty = $costs
        $generator.λ = $Λ
        generator
    end
    return ex_generator
end
```

That works well,

```{julia}
#| output: true

@objective(generator, logitbinarycrossentropy + 0.05distance_l2 + 1.0ddp_diversity)
```

but we should still make sure that this `generator` is also compatible with our package. Below we go through some of the typical workflows associated with Counterfactual Explanations. Firstly, we load some synthetic data and fit a black-box model to it.

```{julia}
using CounterfactualExplanations.Models: fit_model
n_dim = 2
n_classes = 4
n_samples = 400
model_name = :MLP
counterfactual_data = TaijaData.load_blobs(n_samples; k=n_dim, centers=n_classes) |>
    data -> CounterfactualData(data...)
M = fit_model(counterfactual_data, model_name)
plot(M, counterfactual_data)
```

Next, we begin by specifying our target and factual label. We then draw a random sample from the non-target (factual) class.

```{julia}
# Factual and target:
target = 2
factual = 4
chosen = rand(findall(predict_label(M, counterfactual_data) .== factual))
x = select_factual(counterfactual_data,chosen)
```

Finally, we use our `generator` to generate counterfactuals:

```{julia}
using CounterfactualExplanations.Convergence
ce = generate_counterfactual(
    x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator;
    num_counterfactuals = 5,
    convergence = GeneratorConditionsConvergence()
)
```

It worked! 🎉 The resulting counterfactual search is illustrated in @fig-search. I may have overspecified the size of the `ddp_diversity` penalty a little bit here, but it sure makes for a cool chart!

```{julia}
#| fig-cap: "Counterfactual search using our composed generator."
#| label: fig-search
#| output: true
#| echo: false

plot(ce)
```

Time for me to add this all to [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) ... ⏳

## 🧼 Hygiene

... aaand I'm back. There was one thing I had ignored that ended up causing a minor complication: macro [hygiene](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.8/manual/metaprogramming/#Hygiene).  

Again, I'll leave it to you to read up on the details, but the bottom line is that when writing macros, we need to keep variable scopes in mind. [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) is composed of various (sub)modules, and when I initially added the macro to the `CounterfactualExplanations.Generators` module, it errored. 

The problem was (I believe) that the `generator` variable existed in the global scope (`Main`) but it was not accessible for the `@objective` macro that at runtime lives in `Main.Generators`. Fortunately, it is easy to make the variable accessible by wrapping it inside an `esc()` call:

> This escaping mechanism can be used to "violate" hygiene when necessary, in order to introduce or manipulate user variables. 

This may not be the ideal way to do this, and as always, if you have any suggestions I'd be happy to hear about them. 

If you want to find out more about how macros can now be used to easily compose counterfactual generators, check out the new section in the package [documentation](https://juliatrustworthyai.github.io/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/v0.1/tutorials/generators/).

## 🌯 Wrapping Up

In this blog post, I've done something I usually try to avoid: talk about things I don't know. Metaprogramming is an exciting topic and if you're still here, you just got to experience it through the lens of an absolute novice. During our leap of faith into Julia's metaverse we've learned the following things:

1. Code in Julia is internally represented as a mutable data structure.
2. Macros are a way to take such data structures and transform them before they get evaluated at runtime. 
3. An important thing to keep in mind when writing macros is variable scopes. 

Throughout this post, I have skipped various important details that (I think) were not immediately relevant to the goal I had in mind: adding my first macro to  [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl). In the future, I may write about this topic again and cover some of these missing details (hopefully with a bit more insight at that point!).
