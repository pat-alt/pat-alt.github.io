  A short introduction to using, building and contributing Quarto extensions.

I've said it before: Quarto is amazing! Since the beginning of my PhD I haven't used any other tool for prototyping, writing and publishing any of my work.^[Not entirely true: I've also used `Pluto.jl` ðŸŽˆ and had to resort to `.Rmd` in one particular case.] That work has included: this website, presentations, academic articles, notebooks and more. By highlighting useful features of Quarto in articles like this one, I hope to encourage more people to try it out. 

While I'm convinced that Quarto can be useful in almost any context including industry, I realize that certain obstacles may have so far prevented some of you from using it. One such obstacle concerns custom formats: the standard Quarto formats for HTML, PDF, Revealjs, etc. are slick but minimalistic. For many formats, there are various themes to choose from, but they too lack personal touch (or corporate identity in the industry setting). 

At first sight, traditional publishing tools like MS Office seem to have an edge here: customization is made easy though GUIs and standardization through templates is possible to a certain degree. I understand the appeal, but still encourage you to look beyond MS Word, Powerpoint and Beamer presentations. To this end, I've put together this short tutorial that explains how I have built and contributed a TU Delft theme for Revealjs. If nothing else, this theme can be used by my colleagues at Delft University of Technology to create beautiful, Delft-styled presentations with ease.
