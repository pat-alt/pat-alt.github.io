- Softmax puts a lot of pressure on final layer and "Any degree of linear separability in the intermediate layers happens only as a by-product.""
- "On one hand, we have that every layer has less information than its parent layer. On the other hand, we observe experimentally in Section 3.5, 4.1 and 4.2 that features from deeper layers work better with linear classifiers to predict the target labels.""
