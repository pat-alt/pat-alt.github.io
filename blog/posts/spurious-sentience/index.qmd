Us humans are prone to seek patterns everywhere. Meaningful patterns have often proven to help us make sense of our past, navigate our presence and predict the future. Our society is so invested in finding patterns that today it seems we are more willing than ever to outsource this task to an Artificial Intelligence: an omniscient oracle that leads us down the right path. Unfortunately, history has shown time and again that patterns are double-edged swords: if we attribute the wrong meaning to them, they may lead us nowhere at all, or worse, they may lead us down the dark roads. 

In statistics, misleading patterns are referred to as [**spurious relationships**](): purely associational relationships between two or more variables that are not causally related to each other at all. For example,
