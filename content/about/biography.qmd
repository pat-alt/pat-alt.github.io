:::

I’m a trained economist, computer scientist and researcher. In my research, I have challenged long-standing paradigms in explainable AI, developed novel methods to make AI more trustworthy and questioned hyperbolic claims about AGI. I am also experienced open-source software developer and the core developer and maintainer of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia ([Taija](www.taija.org)).

Previously, I worked as an economist for [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk){target="_blank"} where I was involved in research, monetary policy, market intelligence and software development. I hold a Ph.D. from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/), two masters degrees from [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu){target="_blank"} in data science and economics and finance, and an undergraduate degree in economics from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk){target="_blank"}.
