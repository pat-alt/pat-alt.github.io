### News

- In May 2024, I'll be in London, UK, to present research at ECONDAT 2024 (King's College London), The Alan Turing Institute and Imperial College London. If you're around, come say hi!
- Our position paper "Against Spurious Sparks---Dovelating Inflated AI Claims üïäÔ∏è" has been accepted at ICML 2024. We argue that finding patterns in latent embeddings of models like LLMs is not surprising and call for the academic community to exercise extra caution when interpreting such findings. [[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03962)], [[blog post](/blog/posts/spurious-sparks/index.qmd)]
- I was at [AAAI 2024](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/) in Vancouver, Canada presenting our work on *Faithful Model Explanations through Energy-Constrained Conformal Counterfactuals*. If you're around, come say hi! [[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10648)], [[blog](/blog/posts/eccco/index.qmd)], [[TDS](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ecccos-from-the-black-box-c4bd6ef20263)], [[code](https://github.com/pat-alt/ECCCo.jl)], [[slides/poster](/content/talks/posts/2024-aaai/index.qmd)]
- I've published a new lightweight Julia package for working with the Trillion Dollar Words dataset, model and embeddings. Find out more about it [here](/blog/posts/trillion-dollar-words/index.qmd).
- The [Taija](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI) package ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia is slowly growing. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch!
- As of September 15, 2023, I'm a third-year PhD student. I'm still loving the experience, although second year did get a bit stressful at times. I'm looking forward to the next two years!
