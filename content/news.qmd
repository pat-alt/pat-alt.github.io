### News

- I'm at [AAAI 2024](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/) in Vancouver, Canada presenting our work on *Faithful Model Explanations through Energy-Constrained Conformal Counterfactuals*. If you're around, come say hi! [[preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10648)], [[blog](/blog/posts/eccco/index.qmd)], [[TDS](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ecccos-from-the-black-box-c4bd6ef20263)], [[code](https://github.com/pat-alt/ECCCo.jl)], [[slides/poster](/content/talks/posts/2024-aaai/index.qmd)]
- I've published a new lightweight Julia package for working with the Trillion Dollar Words dataset, model and embeddings. Find out more about it [here](/blog/posts/trillion-dollar-words/index.qmd).
- We have a new preprint out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03962) where we argue that finding patterns in latent embeddings of LLMs is interesting but not surprising. We should be careful with the conclusions we draw from these patterns. Here's a [blog post](/blog/posts/spurious-sparks/index.qmd) with high-level details.
- The [Taija](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI) package ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia is slowly growing. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch!
- I recently gave a long presentation about faithful model explanations at the Dutch central bank ([De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/)). You can find the slides [here](talks/posts/2023-dnb/presentation.qmd).
- As of September 15, 2023, I'm a third-year PhD student. I'm still loving the experience, although second year did get a bit stressful at times. I'm looking forward to the next two years!
- In one of my latest [blog posts](/blog/posts/conformal-llm/index.qmd) I put `ConformalPrediction.jl` to work and build a chatbot that can be used for Conformal Intent Recognition.
