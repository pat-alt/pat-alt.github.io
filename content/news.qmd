- Our work on *Faithful Model Explanations through Energy-Constrained Conformal Counterfactuals* has been accepted at [AAAI 2024](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/aaai-24-technical-program/) (main track). Details will follow soon!
- The [Taija](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI) package ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia is slowly growing. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch!
- I recently gave a long presentation about faithful model explanations at the Dutch central bank ([De Nederlandsche Bank](https://www.dnb.nl/)). You can find the slides [here](talks/posts/2023-dnb/presentation.qmd).
- As of September 15, 2023, I'm a third-year PhD student. I'm still loving the experience, although second year did get a bit rough at times. I'm looking forward to the next two years!
- In one of my latest [blog posts](/blog/posts/conformal-llm/index.qmd) I put `ConformalPrediction.jl` to work and build a chatbot that can be used for Conformal Intent Recognition.
