Welcome to my website! 

Having worked with R Markdown and some of [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)'s amazing packages for years, I have only now come across his [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package. For a while I have been thinking about a good way to share some of my work and actually started collecting snippets in a [Gitbook](https://pat-alt.github.io/fromScratch/) through [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) quite some time ago. While the book is a work-in-progress that I aim to finish eventually, I will use this website to regularly share content related to my work, research and other things.
