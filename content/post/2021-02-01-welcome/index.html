<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
<p>Having worked with R Markdown and some of <a href="https://yihui.org/">Yihui Xie</a>â€™s amazing packages for years, I have only now come across his <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> package. For a while I have been thinking about a good way to share some of my work and actually started collecting snippets in a <a href="https://pat-alt.github.io/fromScratch/">Gitbook</a> through <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown</a> quite some time ago. While the book is a work-in-progress that I aim to finish eventually, I will use this website to regularly share content related to my work, research and other things.</p>
