In April 2023, I gave a demo at the [NWO ICT.Open](https://ictopen.nl/) about our ongoing efforts to build and grow [Taija](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI): an Open-Source ecosystem for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia. You can find the slides [here](presentation.qmd){target="_blank"}.
