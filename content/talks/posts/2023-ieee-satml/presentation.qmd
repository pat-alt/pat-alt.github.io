# Motivation and Contributions

## In a nutshell ... 

> [...] we run experiments that simulate the application of recourse in practice using various state-of-the-art counterfactual generators and find that all of them induce substantial domain and model shifts.

:::{.incremental}
- **Counterfactual Explanation** (CE) explain how inputs into a model need to change for it to produce different outputs.
- Counterfactual Explanations that involve realistic and actionable changes can be used for the purpose of **Algorithmic Recourse** (AR) to help individuals who face adverse outcomes.
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note icon=false}

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- We find that the induced shifts are substantial enough to likely impede the applicability of Algorithmic Recourse in some situations.
- Fortunately, we find various strategies to mitigate these concerns. 
- Our simulation framework for studying recourse dynamics is fast and open-sourced. 

:::

## Proof-of-Concept

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='60%'}

:::{#exm-credit}

## Consumer Credit 

- Suppose @fig-poc relates to an automated decision-making system used by a retail bank to evaluate credit applicants.
- Creditworthiness decreases in the South-East direction. 
- **Outcome**: bank supplies credit to more borrowers (orange), but these borrowers are riskier on average, which represents a cost to the retail bank.

:::

:::{#exm-student}

## Student Admission

- Suppose @fig-poc relates to an automated decision-making system used by a university in its student admission process. 
- Likelihood of students completing their degree decreases in the South-East direction. 
- **Outcome**: more students are admitted to university (orange), but they are more likely to fail their degree; the university suspends its efforts to offer AR, which represents a cost to future applicants.

# Gradient-Based Recourse Revisited {#method}

## Algorithmic Recourse

> Even though [...] interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the “black box”.
> [@wachter2017counterfactual]

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Framework

. . .

Objective originally proposed by @wachter2017counterfactual is as follows

$$
\min_{x^\prime \in \mathcal{X}} \text{cost}(x^\prime) \ \ \ \mbox{s. t.} \ \ \ M(x^\prime) = y^* 
$$ {#eq-obj}

Typically this is approximated through regularization:

$$
x^\prime = \arg \min_{x^\prime}  \text{yloss}(M(x^\prime),y^*) + \lambda \text{cost}(x^\prime) 
$$ {#eq-solution}

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Intuition

. . .

![A cat performing gradient descent in the feature space à la @wachter2017counterfactual.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/main/docs/src/www/recourse_mlp.gif){#fig-cat-mlp}

:::

::::

## From individual recourse ... {#method-general}

- We include the following generators in our simulation experiments below: **REVISE** [@joshi2019realistic], **CLUE** [@antoran2020getting], **DiCE** [@mothilal2020explaining] and a **Greedy** approach that relies on probabilistic models [@schut2021generating].

. . .

- All of them can be described by the following generalized form of @eq-solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}^\prime &= \arg \min_{\mathbf{s}^\prime \in \mathcal{S}} \left\{  {\text{yloss}(M(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)),y^*)}+ \lambda {\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)) }  \right\} 
\end{aligned} 
$$ {#eq-general}

. . .

- Here $\mathbf{s}^\prime=\left\{s_k^\prime\right\}_K$ is a $K$-dimensional array of counterfactual states and $f: \mathcal{S} \mapsto \mathcal{X}$ maps from the counterfactual state space to the feature space.

. . .

![Feature space (left) and counterfactual state space (right).](/www/images/example_3d.png){#fig-state-space width="50%"}

## ... towards collective recourse {#method-collective}

- All of the different approaches introduced above tackle the problem of Algorithmic Recourse from the perspective of one **single individual**.

. . .

- We propose to extend @eq-general as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}^\prime &= \arg \min_{\mathbf{s}^\prime \in \mathcal{S}} \{ {\text{yloss}(M(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)),y^*)} \\ &+ \lambda_1 {\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))} + \lambda_2 {\text{extcost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))} \}  
\end{aligned} 
$$ {#eq-collective}

. . .

- Here $\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))$ denotes the proxy for **private costs** faced by the individual; the newly introduced term $\text{extcost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))$ is meant to capture **external costs** generated by changes to $\mathbf{s}^\prime$.

. . .

:::{.callout-note icon="false"}

## 🎓 Negative Externalities

The underlying concept of private and external costs is borrowed from Economics and well-established in that field: when the decisions or actions by some individual market participant generate external costs, then the market is said to suffer from negative externalities and is considered inefficient [@pindyck2014microeconomics].

# Modeling Endogenous Macrodynamics in Algorithmic Recourse {#method-2}

## Research Questions

#### Principal Concerns

::: {#prp-shifts}
## Endogenous Shifts

Does the repeated implementation of recourse provided by state-of-the-art generators lead to shifts in the domain and model?
:::

::: {#prp-costs}
## Costs

If so, are these dynamics substantial enough to be considered costly to stakeholders involved in real-world automated decision-making processes?
:::

::: {#prp-het}
## Heterogeneity

Do different counterfactual generators yield significantly different outcomes in this context? Furthermore, is there any heterogeneity concerning the chosen classifier and dataset?
:::

::: {#prp-drive}
## Drivers

What are the drivers of endogenous dynamics in Algorithmic Recourse?
:::

#### Secondary Concerns

::: {#prp-mitigate}
## Mitigation Strategies

What are potential mitigation strategies with respect to endogenous macrodynamics in AR?
:::

## Empirical Setup

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Evaluation Metrics

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='30%'}
#### Domain Shifts

- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: a measure of the distance between the kernel mean embeddings of two samples; in our context, large values indicate that a domain shift indeed seems to have occurred.

:::
:::{.column width='70%'}
#### Model Shifts

- **Perturbations**: following @upadhyay2021robust we define $\Delta=||\theta_{t+1}-\theta_{t}||^2$, that is the euclidean distance between the vectors of parameters before and after retraining the model $M$.
- **Predicted Probability MMD (PP MMD)**: instead of applying MMD to features directly, we apply it to the predicted probabilities assigned to a set of samples by the model $M$.
- **Disagreement Coefficient**: this metric was introduced in @hanneke2007bound and estimates $p(M(x) \neq M^\prime(x))$, that is the probability that two classifiers disagree on the predicted outcome for a randomly chosen sample.
- **Decisiveness**: we define the metric simply as ${\frac{1}{N}}\sum_{i=0}^N(\sigma(M(x)) - 0.5)^2$ where $M(x)$ are predicted logits from a binary classifier and $\sigma$ denotes the sigmoid function; it quantifies the likelihood that a model assigns a high probability to its classification of any given sample.
- **Performance**: we compute the classifier's F-score on a test sample that we leave untouched throughout the experiment.

### Models

#### Classifiers

1. Simple linear classifier---**Logistic Regression**.
2. Multilayer perceptron---**MLP**.
3. **Deep Ensemble** composed of five MLPs following @lakshminarayanan2016simple.

#### Generative Models

Different specifications of a plain-vanilla Variational Autoencoder (**VAE**)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-models
#| tbl-cap: "Model parameters."

  "Model" = c("MLP","MLP","VAE","VAE"),
  "Data" = c("Synthetic", "Real-World", "Synthetic", "Real-World"),
  "Hidden" = c(32,64,32,32),
  "Latent" = c("-","-",2,8),
  "Layers" = c(1,2,1,1),
  "Batch" = c("-",500,"-","-"),
  "Dropout" = c("-",0.1,"-","-"),
  "Epochs" = c(100,100,100,250)
)
library(kableExtra)
kbl(
  tab, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Neural network architectures and training parameters.',
  col.names = c("Model","Data","Hidden Dim.","Latent Dim.","Hidden Layers", "Batch", "Dropout", "Epochs")

### Data {#empirical-data}

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='50%'}
#### Synthetic Data

Four synthetic binary classification datasets consisting of 1000 samples each: **Overlapping**, **Linearly Separable**, **Circles** and **Moons** (@fig-synthetic-data).

Samples from the negative class ($y=0$) are marked in orange while samples of the positive class ($y=1$) are marked in blue.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/endogenous-macrodynamics-in-algorithmic-recourse/main/paper/www/synthetic_data.png){#fig-synthetic-data}
:::
:::{.column width='50%'}
#### Real-World Data

Three real-world datasets from the Finance and Economics domain: all tabular and can be used for binary classification. 

1. The **Give Me Some Credit** dataset: predict whether a borrower is likely to experience financial difficulties in the next two years [@kaggle2011give].
2. The **UCI defaultCredit** dataset [@yeh2009comparisons]: a benchmark dataset that can be used to train binary classifiers to predict the whether credit card clients default on their payment.
3. The **California Housing** dataset [@pedregosa2011scikitlearn, @pace1997sparse]: continuous outcome variable binarized as $\tilde{y}=\mathbb{I}_{y>\text{median}(Y)}$ indicating if the median house price of a given district is above the median of all districts.

## Summary of Findings

#### Principal Concerns

- Firstly, endogenous dynamics do emerge in our experiments (@prp-shifts) and we find them substantial enough to be considered costly (@prp-costs)
- Secondly, the choice of the counterfactual generator matters, with Latent Space search generally having a dampening effect (@prp-het). 
- The observed dynamics, therefore, seem to be driven by a discrepancy between counterfactual outcomes that minimize costs to individuals and outcomes that comply with the data-generating process (@prp-drive). 

#### Secondary Concerns

- Our findings indicate that all three proposed mitigation strategies are at least at par with LS generators (@prp-mitigate).

# Discussion

## Key Takeaways 🔑

. . .

> Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art approaches to Algorithmic Recourse induce substantial domain and model shifts.

. . .

> We would argue that the expected external costs of individual recourse should be shared by all stakeholders.

. . .

> A straightforward way to achieve this is to penalize external costs in the counterfactual search objective function (@eq-collective).

. . .

> Various simple strategies based on this notion can be effectively used to mitigate shifts.


## Limitations

. . .

#### Private vs. External Costs

- We fall short of providing any definitive answers as to how to trade off private vs. external costs.
- Proposed strategies are a good starting point, but they are ad-hoc.

. . .

#### Experimental Setup

- Experimental design is a vast over-simplification of potential real-world scenarios.

. . .

#### Causal Modelling

- Have focused on popular counterfactual generators that do not incorporate any causal knowledge.
- Perturbations therefore may involve changes to variables that affect the outcome predicted by the black-box model, but not the true, causal outcome.
- Future work would likely benefit from including recent approaches to AR that incorporate causal knowledge such @karimi2021algorithmic. 

. . .

#### Classifiers

- We have limited our analysis to differentiable linear and non-linear classifiers; empirical evidence suggests that other models such as boosted decision trees outperform DL on tabular data (@borisov2021deep, @grinsztajn2022why).
