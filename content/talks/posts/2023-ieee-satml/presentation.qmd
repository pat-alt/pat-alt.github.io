# Motivation and Contributions

## In a nutshell ... 

> [...] we run experiments that simulate the application of recourse in practice using various state-of-the-art counterfactual generators and find that all of them induce substantial domain and model shifts.

- **Counterfactual Explanation** (CE) explain how inputs into a model need to change for it to produce different outputs.
- Counterfactual Explanations that involve realistic and actionable changes can be used for the purpose of **Algorithmic Recourse** (AR) to help individuals who face adverse outcomes.

![Dynamics in Algorithmic Recourse: (a) we have a simple linear classifier trained for binary classification where samples from the negative class ($y=0$) are marked in blue and samples of the positive class ($y=1$) are marked in orange; (b) the implementation of AR for a random subset of individuals leads to a noticable domain shift; (c) as the classifier is retrained we observe a corresponding model shift; (d) as this process is repeated, the decision boundary moves away from the target class.](/www/images/ieee_poc.png){#fig-poc}

:::{.callout-tip}

## 🔑 Key Contributions

- We find that the induced shifts are substantial enough to likely impede the applicability of Algorithmic Recourse in some situations.
- Fortunately, we find various strategies to mitigate these concerns. 
- Our simulation framework for studying recourse dynamics is fast and open-sourced. 

:::

## Consumer Credit Example

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose @fig-poc relates to an automated decision-making system used by a retail bank to evaluate credit applicants with respect to their creditworthiness. 
- Assume that the two features are meaningful in the sense that creditworthiness increases in the south-east direction. 
- Then we can think of the outcome in panel (d) as representing a situation where the bank supplies credit to more borrowers (orange), but these borrowers are on average less creditworthy and more of them can be expected to default on their loan. 
- This represents a cost to the retail bank.
:::

## Student Admission Example

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose Figure @fig-poc relates to an automated decision-making system used by a university in its student admission process. 
- Assume that the two features are meaningful in the sense that the likelihood of students completing their degree increases in the south-east direction. 
- Then we can think of the outcome in panel (b) as representing a situation where more students are admitted to university (orange), but they are more likely to fail their degree than students that were admitted in previous years. 
- The university admission committee catches on to this and suspends its efforts to offer Algorithmic Recourse. 
- This represents an opportunity cost to future student applicants, that may have derived utility from being offered recourse.

# Background

## Algorithmic Recourse

> Even though [...] interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the “black box”.

#### Framework

. . .

Objective originally proposed by @wachter2017counterfactual is as follows

$$
\min_{x^\prime \in \mathcal{X}} \text{cost}(x^\prime) \ \ \ \mbox{s. t.} \ \ \ M(x^\prime) = y^* 
$$ {#eq-obj}

Typically this is approximated through regularization:

$$
x^\prime = \arg \min_{x^\prime}  \text{yloss}(M(x^\prime),y^*) + \lambda \text{cost}(x^\prime) 
$$ {#eq-solution}

# Gradient-Based Recourse Revisited {#method}

## From individual recourse ... {#method-general}

- We include the following generators in our simulation experiments below: **REVISE** [@joshi2019realistic], **CLUE** [@antoran2020getting], **DiCE** [@mothilal2020explaining] and a greedy approach that relies on probabilistic models [@schut2021generating].
- All of them can be described by the following generalized form of Equation \@ref(eq:general):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}^\prime &= \arg \min_{\mathbf{s}^\prime \in \mathcal{S}} \left\{  {\text{yloss}(M(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)),y^*)}+ \lambda {\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)) }  \right\} 
\end{aligned} 
$$ {#eq-general}

- Here $\mathbf{s}^\prime=\left\{s_k^\prime\right\}_K$ is a $K$-dimensional array of counterfactual states and $f: \mathcal{S} \mapsto \mathcal{X}$ maps from the counterfactual state space to the feature space.

## ... towards collective recourse {#method-collective}

- All of the different approaches introduced above tackle the problem of Algorithmic Recourse from the perspective of one single individual.
- We propose to extend Equation @eq-general as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{s}^\prime &= \arg \min_{\mathbf{s}^\prime \in \mathcal{S}} \{ {\text{yloss}(M(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime)),y^*)} \\ &+ \lambda_1 {\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))} + \lambda_2 {\text{extcost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))} \}  
\end{aligned} 
$$ {#eq-collective}

- Here $\text{cost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))$ denotes the proxy for private costs faced by the individual as before and $\lambda_1$ governs to what extent that private cost ought to be penalized. 
- The newly introduced term $\text{extcost}(f(\mathbf{s}^\prime))$ is meant to capture and address external costs incurred by the collective of individuals in response to changes in $\mathbf{s}^\prime$.
- The underlying concept of private and external costs is borrowed from Economics and well-established in that field: when the decisions or actions by some individual market participant generate external costs, then the market is said to suffer from negative externalities and is considered inefficient [@pindyck2014microeconomics].

# Modeling Endogenous Macrodynamics in Algorithmic Recourse {#method-2}

## Research Questions

::: {.proposition #shifts name="Endogenous Shifts"}
Does the repeated implementation of recourse provided by state-of-the-art generators lead to shifts in the domain and model?
:::

::: {.proposition #costs name="Costs"}
If so, are these dynamics substantial enough to be considered costly to stakeholders involved in real-world automated decision-making processes?
:::

::: {.proposition #het name="Heterogeneity"}
Do different counterfactual generators yield significantly different outcomes in this context? Furthermore, is there any heterogeneity concerning the chosen classifier and dataset?
:::

::: {.proposition #drive name="Drivers"}
What are the drivers of endogenous dynamics in Algorithmic Recourse?

## $\mathcal{D}$---Data {#empirical-data}

### Synthetic Data

We use four synthetic binary classification datasets consisting of 1000 samples each: **Overlapping**, **Linearly Separable**, **Circles** and **Moons** @fig-synthetic-data.

![Synthetic classification datasets used in our experiments. Samples from the negative class ($y=0$) are marked in blue while samples of the positive class ($y=1$) are marked in orange.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pat-alt/endogenous-macrodynamics-in-algorithmic-recourse/main/paper/www/synthetic_data.png){#fig-synthetic-data}

### Real-World Data

We use three different real-world datasets from the Finance and Economics domain, all of which are tabular and can be used for binary classification. 

1. The **Give Me Some Credit** dataset: predict whether a borrower is likely to experience financial difficulties in the next two years [@kaggle2011give].
2. The **UCI defaultCredit** dataset [@yeh2009comparisons]: a benchmark dataset that can be used to train binary classifiers to predict the whether credit card clients default on their payment.
3. The **California Housing** dataset [@pedregosa2011scikitlearn, @pace1997sparse]: continuous outcome variable binarized as $\tilde{y}=\mathbb{I}_{y>\text{median}(Y)}$ indicating if the median house price of a given district is above the median of all districts.

## $G$---Generators

- All generators introduced earlier are included in the experiments: Wachter [@wachter2017counterfactual], REVISE [@joshi2019realistic], CLUE [@antoran2020getting], DiCE [@mothilal2020explaining] and Greedy [@schut2021generating]. 
- In addition, we introduce two new generators in Section \@ref(mitigate) that directly address the issue of endogenous domain and model shifts. We also test to what extent it may be beneficial to combine ideas underlying the various generators.
