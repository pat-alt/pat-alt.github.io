These [slides](presentation.qmd){target="_blank"} were used for a tutorial introducing a group of bachelor and master students to working with Julia on the [DelftBlue](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc/system) supercomputer. The following topics were covered:
 
1. Native and intuitive support for different forms of [parallelization](https://juliatrustworthyai.github.io/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/stable/tutorials/parallelization/) offered by [CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl).
2. Common challenges and solutions when working with Julia on one of TU Delft's clusters (see also this unpolished [repo](https://github.com/pat-alt/julia-hpc-for-dummies) with examples).
3. Interactive session where students were guided towards running their first benchmark of counterfactual explanations on [DelftBlue](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc/system) (see also [docs](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/howtos/Julia-with-MPI/)).
