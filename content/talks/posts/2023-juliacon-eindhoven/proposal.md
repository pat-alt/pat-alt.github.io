# Trustworthy AI meets Supercomputing

**Abstract**: Various ongoing efforts towards making artificial intelligence more trustworthy have one thing in common: they typically increase the overall computational burden involved in training and using machine learning models. To overcome this burden we can either write more performant software or maximise our utilization of existing hardware through parallelization ... or we can do both! This talk will discuss [Taija](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI)'s recent venture into supercomputing: challenges, success stories and plans for the future. 

## Description

demonstrate how [`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl) has been enhanced to easily allow users to explain many machine learning models in parallel. We will cover success stories and challenges involved in getting our software ready for use on [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/)'s supercomputers.
