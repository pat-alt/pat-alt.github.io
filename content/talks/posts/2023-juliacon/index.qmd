In July 2023, I gave a talk at JuliaCon 2023 on Predictive Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning using [`ConformalPrediction.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/ConformalPrediction.jl). The conference was held in person at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. You can find the slides below or click [here](presentation.qmd){target="_blank"} to open them in full screen.
