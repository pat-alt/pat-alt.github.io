## Agenda

::: {.incremental}
- **Stocktake**---what has been accomplished and where are we at?
- **Next Steps**---plans for the 3-4 months
- **Big Picture**---putting it all together and some tentative career plans
- **Housekeeping**---meeting series, ...
:::

# Stocktake

## Papers 

Solid progress on chapters 3 to 5 of the thesis:

::: {.incremental}
- 2 papers published (*ECCCo* @ AAAI: [**Ch3**], *Stop Making Unscientific AGI Claims* @ ICML: [**Ch5**]).

:::

## Talks and Posters

A total of 12 talks and posters

::: {.incremental}

- Academia (4): AAAI (poster), ECONDAT, Imperial College London, ICML (poster)
- Companies (3): De Nederlandsche Bank, The Alan Turing Institute, T√úV AI Lab (next week)
- Software (5): JuliaCon (4 talks), *Julia on HPC* tutorial @ TU Delft

:::

## Open Source and Science

::: {.incremental}

- Unified ecosystem for Trustworthy AI in Julia, [Taija](https://www.taija.org/).
  - Continuous maintenance and development, in particular CE.jl, LR.jl and CP.jl.
  - Work on various base and meta packages for parallelization, visualization and more. 
- Published 7 blog posts: [personal](https://www.patalt.org/blog/) (4), [Taija](https://www.taija.org/blog/) (3)
- Mentored two Google/Julia Summer of Code students who contributed to Taija: (1) [causal recourse](https://www.taija.org/blog/posts/causal-recourse/), (2) [conformal Bayes](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/fkvFPluF).

## Graduate School

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='50%'}
- 1 Research project (4 ECTS: *research*).
- 1 Software project (2 ECTS: *research*).
- 4 Master's theses (4 ECTS: *research*)
:::
:::{.column width='50%'}
- NeurIPS 2024 reviewing (3 ECTS: *research*).
- JuliaCon, ICML, AAAI, ECONDAT (2 ECTS each: *research*).
- 2-week Dutch course (4 ECTS: *transferable*).
:::
::::

Total (missing): *research* (-21.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è), *discipline* (5), *transferable* (6)

## Time Management (1)

::: {.incremental}

- Last year I thought it should be feasible to have the following papers in (near-) final form by now: ECCCo [**Ch3**] ‚úÖ, LaplaceRedux [not planned as chapter] ‚úÖ, ~~ConformalPrediction~~ ‚ùå, 3rd research paper [**Ch5**] ‚úÖ.
- At that point, I thought we'd be looking at a comprehensive thesis: JuliaCon paper(s) forming the introduction and 3 research papers forming the core.
  - Still missing work on imroving models üü®üü®üü®üü®‚¨õ 

:::
  
## Time Management (2)

4th year can then be used to:

1. Tackle 4th research paper and collate chapters (thesis).
2. Ensure Taija and Graduate School credits are in order and next career steps are planned.
3. ~~Google Summer of Code~~ ‚úÖ? ~~Teaching~~ ‚úÖ? ~~Research Visit~~? Internship? Book about Taija?
4. ~~Write paper on `JointEnergyModels.jl`.~~

# Next Steps

## CE and Adversial Robustness 

Promising results but ...

- Need more granular grid for gradient-based adversarial training and additional datasets.
- Need to test other forms of adversarial robustness (e.g. LBDN), because
  - Link above has been established to some degree.
  - Link above is not surprising, because AE and CE are virtually identical.

@ ICML 2025, NeurIPS Data & Bmks 2025, workshops, ‚ùì

## Counterfactual Training 

::: {.callout-tip}

## AE ‚äÜ CE

Adversarial Examples (AE) can be thought of as a specific type of CE. Why not use CE in a similar fashion during training?

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='50%'}
::: {.incremental}
- Literature review ‚úÖ
- Proof-of-concept ‚úÖ
- Exploration phase ‚è≥ (until mid-November)

::: {.incremental}
- Run experiments üî≤ (mid-Novermber to early January)
- Wrap up üî≤ (January)

‚ùì Aiming for ICML but in 2024 there was little on CE.

## Summer 2025 

- Connected with Tom Bewley from J.P. Morgan AI Research at ICML and [implemented](https://www.taija.org/blog/posts/counterfactual-rule-explanations/) his paper.
  - Novel approach to generate global counterfactual rule explanations.
  - Motivated me to apply to Summer Associate Program (could work on extension [**Ch6**]), although I was aiming to defend in September.
- Alternatively, hoping for HuggingFace to offer internships again but nothing yet. 

# Beyond PhD

## In an ideal world ...

- Pretty set on either Amsterdam or D√ºsseldorf.
- Leaning towards industry, but remain curious about opportunities in academia.
- Desire to continue with Julia, ideally Taija.
- Continue *developing* and *implementing* interesting research ideas in software, add *application* and *deployment* (research engineer?).
- Curious to explore subject areas outside of my PhD but maintain focus on "AI for Good". 

## Industry

- J.P. Morgan AI Research
- HuggingFace
- EU AI Office
- Julia shops: LazyDynamics, EvoVest

If industry, ideally combine my backgrounds in economics and AI. 

## Academia

- Potentially, post-doc at Delft/VU/UvA with interesting external partner, i.e. any of the companies on previous slide or:
  - EScience Centre
  - DNB (?)
- Assistant professor at Delft (EWI/TPM), VU, UvA
