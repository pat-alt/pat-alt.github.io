# Introduction {.nostretch}

## Motivation {.smaller}

Why Trustworthy AI and why in Julia?

::: {.incremental}

- Opaque AI technologies have entered the public domain with far-reaching stakes.
- These technologies are here to stay, so at best, we can make them more trustworthy. 
- Julia has an edge:
  - **Transparency**: most packages are written in pure Julia.
  - **Intuitiveness**: great Lisp-like support for symbolic computing.
  - **Community**: welcoming, supportive and diverse (sort of!). 
  - **Autodiff**: [top-notch support](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/automatic-differentiation-julia-implementation-advantages/24975), which helps with common XAI approaches.

## Outline

:::{.incremental}

- **Taija**: A brief overview of the [Taija]() ecosystem.
  - Overview, Projects, Research. 
- **Deep Dive**: A closer look at some of our core packages.
  - Counterfactual Explanations, Conformal Prediction, Laplace Redux, Joint Energy Models. 
- **The Journey**: Julia throught my PhD 
  - From "I'll try this out" to "I'll never go back".

## Research {.smaller}

Taija has been used in the following publications:

- *Conformal Intent Classification and Clarification for Fast and Accurate Intent Recognition* [@hengst2024conformal] [upcoming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18973) in ACLâ€™s NAACL Findings 2024^[Experiments were run in parallel using Python's MAPIE and ConformalPrediction.jl, in order to cross-check results. Reported results were produced using MAPIE.].
