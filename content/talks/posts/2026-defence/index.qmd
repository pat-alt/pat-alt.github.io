On Wednesday, February 25, 2026, I publicly defended my Ph.D. at TU Delft. You can find the slides for my layman's talk below or click [here](presentation.html){target="_blank"} to open them in full screen. 

For the PDF version of the slides use this [link](presentation.pdf){target="_blank"} instead.

Finally, don't miss my "[Ph.D. Wrapped](wrapped.pdf){target="_blank"}: a painfully detailed and hilarious recap of my git commit messages over these past few years, laid out in the open and analysed by my students, co-authors and paranymphs, Aleksander Buszydlik and Karol Dobiczek.
