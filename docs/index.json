By fitting each equation of the VAR system with a deep neural network, the Deep VAR outperforms its conventional benchmark in terms of in-sample fit, out-of-sample fit and point forecasting accuracy.","tags":["Deep Learning","Vector Autoregression","Monetary Policy"],"title":"Deep Vector Autoregression","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"One  **Two**  Three  --- A fragment can accept two optional parameters: - `class`: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) - `weight`: sets the order in which a fragment appears --- ## Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation ```markdown {{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} ``` Press the `S` key to view the speaker notes!
