# Welcome. 

Hello from Eindhoven 


Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence at Delft University of Technology working on the intersection of Computer Science and Finance. 

My current research revolves around Counterfactual Explanations and Probabilistic Machine Learning. Previously, I worked as an Economist for the Bank of England.

I code in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia){target="_blank"} ðŸ”´ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ¢ and publish through [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev){target="_blank"}. Occasionally I also use R, Python and C++. As much as possible I contribute to open-source: [Github](https://github.com/pat-alt){target="_blank"}.
