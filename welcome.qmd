Welcome.

My name is Patrick Altmeyer.

<br>

Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence** at Delft University of Technology working on the intersection of Computer Science and Finance. 

My current research revolves around **Counterfactual Explanations** and **Probabilistic Machine Learning**. Previously, I worked as an Economist for the Bank of England.

I primarily code in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia){target="_blank"} and publish through [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev){target="_blank"}. Occasionally I also use R, Python and C++. As much as possible I contribute to **open-source**: [Github](https://github.com/pat-alt){target="_blank"}.

You can find the code that builds this website using [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev){target="_blank"} in this [repo](https://github.com/pat-alt/pat-alt.github.io){target="_blank"}.
